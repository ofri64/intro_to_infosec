- Again, We will use ptrace to override the function "check_if_virus" to return false indicators on all inputs
(and our malware among them)
- This time we will not use our own custom function,
we will replace the address written in the GOT table to an address of a the function
 we want to replace for "check_if_virus"
- We will look again at the code section for check_if_virus@plt
(in the disassembled code)
- This code section starts with a jump to an address on the GOT -
exactly at the right offset for the check_if_virus function.
- In our case the address of the right offset on the GOT is 0x804a01c.
- So we would like to subtitue the address written there
with the address of our replacement function
 (In the regular scenario, after the dynamic linking is performed it will contain the real address
 of the "check_if_virus function", making sure the linking will occur only once)
- A good function to choose as a replacement function is:
 "is_directory" since it will return 0 for every regular file.
- The "is_directory" function is linked to the binary statically so
can just find its address in the disassembled code (written explicitly in the addresses.py file)
