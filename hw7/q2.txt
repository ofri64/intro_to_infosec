- In this question we will use ptrace to override the function "check_if_virus"
to return false indicators on all inputs
(and our malware among them)
- In this section we will just override the plt code.
i.e, the dynamic linking won't happen at all, instead our logic will get executed.
- The address we want to override with our code is the address of check_if_virus@plt
 (written explicitly in the address.py file)
- We will use PTRACE_POKE to change the content of this specific memory word
 (the command works with an entire word, i.e writing 4 bytes at once)
- We will change the data in the check_if_virus@plt address to "0xc390c031"
which is the opcode for the assembly code: "xor eax, eax; nop; ret" in little endian
(adding nop to complete to exactly 1 memory word)
- This way the call will always return 0, thus detecting every file as clean, including our malware.
