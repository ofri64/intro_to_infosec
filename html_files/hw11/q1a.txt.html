<a name="l1"><span class="ln">1    </span></a><span class="s0">- In this section we perform a stealth port scanning - using SYN packets 
<a name="l2"><span class="ln">2    </span></a> 
<a name="l3"><span class="ln">3    </span></a>- The reason this type of port scanning is also 
<a name="l4"><span class="ln">4    </span></a>called stealth port scanning is that it doesn't 
<a name="l5"><span class="ln">5    </span></a>actually complete the 3 ways handshake and doesn't create an established 
<a name="l6"><span class="ln">6    </span></a>tcp connection to the attacked host 
<a name="l7"><span class="ln">7    </span></a> 
<a name="l8"><span class="ln">8    </span></a>- In practice the attacker sends SYN and then FIN packet so no TCP 
<a name="l9"><span class="ln">9    </span></a> connection/session is established and the attacked host doesn't keep/log 
<a name="l10"><span class="ln">10   </span></a> information about this connection. 
<a name="l11"><span class="ln">11   </span></a> 
<a name="l12"><span class="ln">12   </span></a>- The solution is quite simple. 
<a name="l13"><span class="ln">13   </span></a>First we craft matching TCP-SYN packets for each port 
<a name="l14"><span class="ln">14   </span></a> 
<a name="l15"><span class="ln">15   </span></a>- Then we inspect our responses: 
<a name="l16"><span class="ln">16   </span></a>    - SYN request wasn't answered at all - means the port is filtered 
<a name="l17"><span class="ln">17   </span></a>    - SYN request answered with SYN+ACK response - means the port is 
<a name="l18"><span class="ln">18   </span></a>    open and ready for connection establishment 
<a name="l19"><span class="ln">19   </span></a>    - SYN request answered with RST response - 
<a name="l20"><span class="ln">20   </span></a>    means the host is up, maybe listening on other ports but this specific port is considered close 
<a name="l21"><span class="ln">21   </span></a>- Now all that's left is to iterate over our answers 
<a name="l22"><span class="ln">22   </span></a> (and packets we didn't get any response for) 
<a name="l23"><span class="ln">23   </span></a> and classify depending on the flags in the TCP response.</span></pre>
