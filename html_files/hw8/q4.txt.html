<a name="l1"><span class="ln">1    </span></a><span class="s0">- Again, we are looking for a logical vulnerability in the implementation 
<a name="l2"><span class="ln">2    </span></a>- Clearly we are not going to break RSA, 
<a name="l3"><span class="ln">3    </span></a> So the authentication part using RSA digital signatures is not something we want to tamper. 
<a name="l4"><span class="ln">4    </span></a>- We have a valid version of a command and signed hash matching it 
<a name="l5"><span class="ln">5    </span></a>- Looking at the code we understand that in order to pass the 
<a name="l6"><span class="ln">6    </span></a>RSA authentication test we need that the decoded json 
<a name="l7"><span class="ln">7    </span></a> will have the right value in the &quot;command&quot; and &quot;signature&quot; fields 
<a name="l8"><span class="ln">8    </span></a>  so our json payload must contains these fields. 
<a name="l9"><span class="ln">9    </span></a>- But we are not limited with other fields in the json object, 
<a name="l10"><span class="ln">10   </span></a>we can add other fields and as long as their names do not collide with &quot;command&quot; and &quot;signature&quot; 
<a name="l11"><span class="ln">11   </span></a>we will pass the RSA verification test. 
<a name="l12"><span class="ln">12   </span></a>- The vulnerability here is with Bob's check using regular expressions and not using the decoded json object. 
<a name="l13"><span class="ln">13   </span></a>- All we have to do is to make sure that a string looking like 
<a name="l14"><span class="ln">14   </span></a>&quot;command&quot;: &quot;echo hacked&quot; will be a part of the file content and 
<a name="l15"><span class="ln">15   </span></a>it also has to appear before the real &quot;command&quot; field as regex search finds the first occurrence. 
<a name="l16"><span class="ln">16   </span></a>- Another constraint we have is that our file still needs to be a valid json object so 
<a name="l17"><span class="ln">17   </span></a>decoding before the RSA part won't fail. 
<a name="l18"><span class="ln">18   </span></a>- This leads us to construct a payload that looks something like this: 
<a name="l19"><span class="ln">19   </span></a>{&lt;some string as key&gt;: {&quot;command&quot;: &quot;echo hacked&quot;} + &lt;original payload&gt; 
<a name="l20"><span class="ln">20   </span></a>which is a valid json object (nested one), 
<a name="l21"><span class="ln">21   </span></a>it passes the RSA verification test and the re.search 
<a name="l22"><span class="ln">22   </span></a>finds the first occurrence of the type &quot;command&quot;:</span></pre>
