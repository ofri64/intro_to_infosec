- We will use the same exchange mechanism as before but now with encryption

- for aes encryption we will need our message size to be
a multiple of 16 so we will add padding

- using the pkcs7 padding scheme we will always add padding -
between 1 and 16 bytes (16 if our message length is already a multiple of 16)

- the pkcs7 adds as padding the value of the number of padding bytes add
 (i.e the options are 0x01 to 0x0f)

- After adding padding winston will encrypt it's message
using aes with the secret key he and julia knows

- Julia will receive the message as before,
decrypt it, and remove the padding (explained in the code documentation).
