- This section includes few separated phases

- Encoding the message data as a multiple of bits triplets:

	- This is necessary because we have only 3 reserved bits in the tcp header

	- In order to ensure the length of the encoding of the message to bits
	string will be a multiple of 3 I leveraged base64 encoding

	- First encode the message to base64 encoding.
	each char in base64 encoding is represented in 6 bits.
	So we can encode base64 chars to bits string and the number of bits will
	 always be a multiple of 6, so it will also be a multiple of 3 as we need.

	- When we encode base64 chars to bit strings we will ignore padding chars (the '=' char) -
	 this will be handled later during decoding

- Decoding a stream of bits triplets to the original message:
	- Here we will have to perform the reverse logic

	- We will translate every 6 bits to a base64 char

	- Then we will check the total length of our base64 string (number of chars)

	- If the length is not a multiple of 4 -
	 it means the original base64 string included padding.
	 This is because in base64 every 3 bytes are translated to 4 base64 letters.

	- So if the length is not a multiple of 4 -
	we will need to add matching number of padding signs ('=')

	- After we have a valid base64 encoded string (including padding)
	 we can just decode it back

	- See full explanation in code documentation

- Sending tcp packets with encoded message in the reserved bits:

	- After we encoded our message into triplets of bits,
	 winston will craft a tcp packet for each triplet

	- As instructed - the ack number will always be the total number of triplets,
	 and the seq value will indicate the index of the current packet

	- Of course the reserved bits will include the value of the current triplet

- Receiving tcp packets:

	- Julia will have to sniff the network
	(our ack and seq numbers doesn't implement tcp natural mechanism,
	 we won't be able to maintain a connection)

	- Filter only packets from source port 65,000, that contains tcp headers

	- After the first packet was received we know how many packets to look for
	(the ack value) so we can update our stopping criterion for the packet sniffing -
	 when we received a packet with seq number indicating it is the last packet

	- Then, Julia will decode all the bits triplets
	she extracted from the reserved bits and reveal Winston's message
