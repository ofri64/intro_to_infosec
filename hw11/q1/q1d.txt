- In this section we want to report every port is open and make the port scanning attack pointless.

- As seen before, when a host is listening on a port it will replay
 a TCP SYN packet with a SYN + ACK packet to continue the 3-way handshake

- So we want to replay to every SYN packet we receive at any port -
with a SYN+ACK packet to make the port look open

- First we check it is indeed a SYN packet,
we extract from it the source ip, source port and sequence number.

- Then we craft a tcp SYN+ACK response and sent it the ip and port we received the request from.
