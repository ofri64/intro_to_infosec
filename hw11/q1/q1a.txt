- In this section we perform a stealth port scanning - using SYN packets

- The reason this type of port scanning is also
called stealth port scanning is that it doesn't
actually complete the 3 ways handshake and doesn't create an established
tcp connection to the attacked host

- In practice the attacker sends SYN and then FIN packet so no TCP
 connection/session is established and the attacked host doesn't keep/log
 information about this connection.

- The solution is quite simple.
First we craft matching TCP-SYN packets for each port

- Then we inspect our responses:
	- SYN request wasn't answered at all - means the port is filtered
	- SYN request answered with SYN+ACK response - means the port is
	open and ready for connection establishment
	- SYN request answered with RST response -
	means the host is up, maybe listening on other ports but this specific port is considered close
- Now all that's left is to iterate over our answers
 (and packets we didn't get any response for)
 and classify depending on the flags in the TCP response.
