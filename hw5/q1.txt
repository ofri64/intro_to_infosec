Examining the server source code and the binary file using IDA,
we encounter that the server code allocates a fixed size buffer to hold the message received from client.
But, the server does not check that the actual message is indeed limited to this size.

In our case the server code allocates 1KB for a message as we can see in the program's source code.
Using IDA, we see that actually the buffer size on the stack is 1036 bytes.
So, sending a message with a length greater than 1036 bytes will casue overflow.
More detailed - the next 4 bytes will override "old ebp" and another 4 bytes will override RET/eip
