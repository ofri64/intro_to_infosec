- After understaing the structure of the code in the previous section we now want to override RET/EIP to open a shell
- Using gdb we find the addresses of the the "system" libc call (in libc text segment) and find an occurence of the string "/bin/sh" both in the libc.rodata segment
- The address are: 0xb7c5bda0 for system_libc and 0xb7d7ca0b for "/bin/sh" string
- Thus now, we construct our password with 66 bytes until reaching RET, appending the address of system_libc, appending arbitrary 4 bytes as the return address from system_libc and finally appending the address of the string "/bin/sh"
