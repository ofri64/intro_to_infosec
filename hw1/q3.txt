The program counts the number of characters in a given string, assuming that the base address
 of the string is saved in the register ESI.

Clarifications:
- XOR of a binary string with itself is always 0.
- Hence DL is also 0.
- The result is saved in ECX, which make sense because ECX is used for counting, by convention.
