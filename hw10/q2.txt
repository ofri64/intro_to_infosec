- In order to perform the desired functionality we probably have to post something as a message.

- This is because we cannot write our code locally - it won't effect other users logging in.

- So, we will have to save somehow the script we want other clients to execute, on the server db.

- The instructions say our attack should work regardless of the channel the user is viewing.
 So, we cannot post a message in a specific channel because it will trigger our code
  only when the user is viewing the specific channel

- But, we can notice that the channels list always appears on the page! no matter what channel we view.

- Given the possbile add new channels mechanism exposed by the server
(saves content to the server db),
and the hint to inject a "<script>" tag
we would try to create a new channel with a name that will include a script,
 hopefully there are no sanity checks on the channel name (which is indeed the case...)

- The script we want to initiate is: "$.post("post", { channel: "#general-spam", message : "Good Morning!"})</script>".
 We know that after examining what happens when we post a message -
 a "POST" request is sent to the server with "channel" and "message" form fields

- Summarizing it all - we want to send the following message (no matter on which channel):
 /join #got-u-online <script>$.post("post", { channel: "#general-spam", message : "Good Morning!"})</script>

- This way, every time the channels list appear
(which is every time a user requests the page),
when loading our new channel name, our script will evaluate either.
