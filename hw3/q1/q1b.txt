Understanding the logic from previous section, we can easily manipulate the msg files
to pass the validation test.
In this section we can change the msg file as follows:

- Change byte[0] to 0
- Change byte[1] to key value (In our case 0xe8)
- Leave the rest of the msg unchanged.

Meaning we will make zero XOR operations, and compare our initial key to byte[1],
which will be equal following directly from our manipulation. Thus, we pass the validation test :)
