Part 1: Understanding the flow of the entire program
- The program reads 1KB (or less) from the given file, saving it to an array on the stack
- If the file doesn't exist, cannot be open, or read error occurs - return error code and exit
- The array base address is passed to the function "validate"

Part 2: Function validate
- This is the heart of the code, that consists the actual logic.
- The algorithm will be as follows:
	- Initiate an int counter to zero (save it to bsp-8)
	- Read the first byte (byte 0) from the file (save it to bsp-4)
	- Read the next byte (byte 1), save it to bsp-9
	- The code defines a key for the algorithm - save it to the stack on bsp-10
	- Use byte[0] as coutner argumnt of the for loop - tells us how many iterations needed
	- Inside the loop, XOR the current byte (starting from byte[2] at first iteration)
	 with the result of XOR from last iteration (for first iteration XOR with key)
	- Increment Counter
	- After exiting loop, compare the last xor result to byte[1] of the file (bsp-9)
	 and return True if they match and False otherwise.
