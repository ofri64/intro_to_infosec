Similar to our previous section, we will perfrom the following manipulation:

- Change byte[0] to 1
- Change byte[1] to 0
- Change byte[2] to key value (In our case 0xe8)
- Leave the rest of the msg unchanged.

Meaning we will make 1 XOR operations - XOR key with the identical byte[2], getting 0 as a result
Then, the program will compare our 0 result with byte[1] which also equals 0, again
follows directly from out manipulation.
The values match so again we do pass the validation test :)
