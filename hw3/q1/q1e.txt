- Similar to previous section all we want to do is patch the return value of the program,
regardless of the program logic itself
- Again, looking in IDA we see that if the message is valid we move into EAX the value 0
(EAX will contain the return value of the program).
- If the message is not valie we move into EAX the value 1 - this is where we want to patch our code
- We see the offset is 0x6DD, the first byte is the opcode
(0xB8, telling us it is a mov EAX instruction), the last 4 bytes are the immediate operand in little endian
 (0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00 which means 1)
- So the patch we need is to replace the byte 0x6DE to 0x00,
 resulting in the following commad: MOV EAX 0.
- This doesn't change the output to the screen or the validation test,
only changes the return value of the function in cases where the validation test failed.
