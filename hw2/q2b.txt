The exploit we take advantage of in this section is the short length of the exponent (e) of the public key.
We use the fact that if e is small enough (which applies in this case) the encryption procedure translates to:
m^e (mod n) == m^e (becasue m^e is much smaller than n - meaning m^e / n will be equal to zero with a reminder of exactly m^e)
This means that we can extract the original message m simply by computing m = (m^e) ^ (1/e).
In our case e=3 so we just need to power the encrypted message by (1/3) to get the original message m.
