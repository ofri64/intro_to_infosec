- The intuition for the scoring function is using the known distribution of letters in english text.
- Then, measure the difference between the distribution of the so called decrypted text and the this known distribution.
- We will assume the english letters frequency is a discrete distribution as detailed in Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency)
- We will compute the decrypted text distribution simply by counting how many times a letter appears in the decrypted text and normalize with dividing by the text lengh.
- In order to measure the difference between the two distributions we will use chi-square distribution (without actually performing the chi-square test, just using the statistic's value. reference can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test)
- Identical distribution will get value 0 and the value will grow as the distributions differ.
- So we will setup our score function as -1 * chi-square value, representing the difference between the theoretical distibution and the empirical one. This way the maximum value in bounded to 0 in case of identical distributions.
- Another optimization would be to add a penalty for every non-printable char in our candidate decrypted text.
Using a penalty of -0.3 for each such char (probably want to value of penalty to be an hyperparameter that can be sadjusted)
