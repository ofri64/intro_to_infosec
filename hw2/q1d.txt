- We implement brute force search and choosing between decryption keys
according to their output score (using the scoring function from last section)
- We assume that the decrypted text with the highest score value will have
the highest probability of being the origianl plain text message.
- Notice the use of python's itertools module to enumerate all possible keys
(instead of using a recursive function for doing it)
