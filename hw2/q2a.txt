The exploit we take advantage of in this section is the short length of the message.
In our case, the credit card PIN code is sent in a separated message by it self.
Thus, we know that the message length is 4 charactes long, and there are 10^4 = 10,000 possible PIN codes.
The method just exhaust over all possible PIN codes, encrypting each one of them, and comparing the results with our encrypted text.
One of the PIN codes must match because the encryption algorithm is deterministic.
