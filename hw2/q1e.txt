- Up until now we did not used the fact that the chiper is a repeated key cipher.
- Instead of using frequency analysis with brute force as we did in the preivous sections,
 we will perform frequency analysis for each byte of the key and combine the results
- Hopefully, for long enough texts we will have enough data for each "bucket"
(text encrypted by the same byte of the key) so that frequency analysis will be useful.
- This method reduces the number of key combinatios from 256 ^ key_length to 256 * key_length.
- Please also notice the following:
	- The helper methods in the class "_divide_cipher_by_key_byte" and "_concatenate_key_byte_decrypted"
	 used to diving and conatenate the encypted text to characters encrypted with same byte of the key.
	- We are using the same "brute force" method we used before, with the same scoring function,
	for every byte of the key seperatly.
	- Important parts of the code are also documented within the code itself.
