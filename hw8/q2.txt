- Obviously the logical vulnerabilty in this section is unpacking a pickled object from an unknown sourch (user input)
- Reading a little bit about pickle - we understand that it is just serialization/deserialization mechanism.
- In python, we have a way to "mark" for a custom object, how it needs to be serialized. We do that by using the __reduce__ method.
- In conclusion - all we had to do is define a new class, implement the __reduce__ method with the command we want to execute, and serialize the object using "pickle" module and save the result to the file
- The "serialized" version of our custom object will be a command to execute.
- So, when we unpack/deserialized the object the commaned is being executed.
